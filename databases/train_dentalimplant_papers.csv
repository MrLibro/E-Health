0,"Dental implants have increased in the last few decades thus increasing the number of complications. Since many of these complications are easily diagnosed on postsurgical images, it is important for radiologists to be familiar with them and to be able to recognize and diagnose them. Radiologists should also have a basic understanding of their treatment. In a pictorial fashion, this article will present the basic complications of dental implants which we have divided into three general categories: biomechanical overload, infection or inflammation, and other causes. Examples of implant fracture, loosening, infection, inflammation from subgingival cement, failure of bone and soft tissue preservation, injury to surround structures, and other complications will be discussed as well as their common imaging appearances and treatment. Lastly, we will review pertinent dental anatomy and important structures that are vital for radiologists to evaluate in postoperative oral cavity imaging."
1,"Purpose: To propose a length-and-diameter-based classification scheme for dental implants to standardize terminology in the dental literature and communication between interested parties. This study was mainly based on searching two major resources: published scientific research papers and 14 of the most popular dental implant manufacturers. Indexed databases were searched from January 2004 up to and including February 2016 using the  'dental implant length' and 'dental implant diameter.' Retrieved titles and abstracts were screened, and related full-text articles were reviewed. Full-text articles that clearly stated the terms and measurements of implants used were included and considered for proposing this classification scheme. : The initial search for implant diameter and length yielded 1007 and 936 articles, respectively. A total of 85 studies (41 about diameter, 44 about length) were selected and reviewed. The remaining studies (966 about diameter, 892 about length) that did not abide by the eligibility criteria were excluded. The terms 'long,' 'short,' 'standard,' 'wide,' and 'narrow' were the most commonly used terms in the literature. A classification scheme for implants by diameter and length was proposed. Conclusions: Indexed publications contain a variety of terms used by authors to describe diameter and length of dental implants without conformity and standardization. The classification scheme proposed in this article could serve as a reference for interested parties: Dental implant; classification; diameter; length; size."
2,"Teeth are vital sensory organs that contribute to our daily activities of living. Unfortunately, teeth can be lost for several reasons including trauma, caries, and periodontal disease. Although dental trauma injuries and caries are more frequently encountered in a younger population, tooth loss because of periodontal disease occurs in the older population. In the dental implant era, the trend sometimes seems to be to extract compromised teeth and replace them with dental implants. However, the long-term prognosis of teeth might not be comparable with the prognosis of dental implants. Complications, failures, and diseases such as peri-implantitis are not uncommon, and, despite popular belief, implants are not 99% successful. Other treatment options that aim to save compromised or diseased teeth such as endodontic treatment, periodontal treatment, intentional replantation, and autotransplantation should be considered on an individual basis. These treatments have competing success rates to dental implants but, more importantly, retain the natural tooth in the dentition for a longer period of time. These options are important to discuss in detail during treatment planning with patients in order to clarify any misconceptions about teeth and dental implants. In the event a tooth does have to be extracted, procedures such as decoronation and orthodontic extrusion might be useful to preserve hard and soft tissues for future dental implant placement. Regardless of the treatment modality, it is critical that strict maintenance and follow-up protocols are implemented and that treatment planning is ethically responsible and evidence based."
3,"Dental implants have become an increasingly popular treatment choice for replacing missing teeth. Yet, little is known about the prevalence and sociodemographic distribution of dental implant use in the United States. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed data from 7 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2016. We estimated dental implant prevalence among adults missing any teeth for each survey period overall as stratified by sociodemographic characteristics. We calculated absolute and relative differences from 1999-2000 to 2015-2016 and fit logistic regression models to estimate changes over time. We also used multivariable logistic regression to estimate independent associations of sociodemographic covariates with the presence of any implant. We projected the proportion of patients treated with dental implants into the year 2026 under varying assumptions of how the temporal trend would continue. There has been a large increase in the prevalence of dental implants, from 0.7% in 1999 to 2000 to 5.7% in 2015 to 2016. The largest absolute increase in prevalence (12.9%) was among individuals 65 to 74 y old, whereas the largest relative increase was ~1,000% among those 55 to 64 y old. There was an average covariate-adjusted increase in dental implant prevalence of 14% per year (95% CI, 11% to 18%). Having private insurance (vs. none or public insurance) or more than a high school education (vs. high school or less) was each associated with a 2-fold increase in prevalence, with an almost 13-fold (95% CI, 8 to21) increase for older adults. Dental implant prevalence projected to 2026 ranged from 5.7% in the most conservative scenario to 23% in the least. This study demonstrates that dental implant prevalence among US adults with missing teeth has substantially increased since 1999. Yet access overall is still very low, and prevalence was consistently higher among more advantaged groups."
4,"Background: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the clinical efficacy of the early dental implant placement protocol with immediate and delayed dental implant placement protocols.: An electronic and manual search of literature was made to identify clinical studies comparing early implant placement with immediate or delayed placement. Data from the included studies were pooled and quantitative analyses were performed for the implant outcomes reported as the number of failed implants (primary outcome variable) and for changes in peri-implant marginal bone level, peri-implant probing depth, and peri-implant soft tissue level (secondary outcome variables).: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Significant difference in risk of implant failure was found neither between the early and immediate placement protocols (risk difference = -0.018; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.06, 0.025; P = 0.416) nor between early and delayed placement protocols (risk difference = -0.008; 95% CI = -0.044, 0.028; P = 0.670). Pooled data of changes in peri-implant marginal bone level demonstrated significantly less marginal bone loss for implants placed using the early placement protocol compared with those placed in fresh extraction sockets (P = 0.001; weighted mean difference = -0.14 mm; 95% CI = -0.22, -0.05). No significant differences were found between the protocols for the other variables.Conclusions: The available evidence supports the clinical efficacy of the early implant placement protocol. Present findings indicate that the early implant placement protocol  in implant outcomes similar to immediate and delayed placement protocols and a superior stability of peri-implant hard tissue compared with immediate implant placement: clinical protocols; dental ; dental implants; meta-analysis; time factors; tooth extraction; tooth socket/surgery."
5,"The development of clinical implant dentistry was intensively affected by dental implant design improvement and innovation, which brought about new concept, even milestone-like changes of clinical protocol. The current improvements of dental implant design and their clinical importance could be highlighted as followings: 1) The implant apical design influences the implant preliminary stability in immediate implant. The apical 3-5 mm design of implant makes implant stable in immediate implant, because this part would be screwed into alveolar bone through fresh socket, the other part of implant could not be tightly screwed in the socket because of smaller implant diameter. Implant apical form, screw design, self-taping of apical part would be essential for immediate implant. 2) The enough preliminary stability of implant makes immediate prosthesis possible. When osseointegration does not occur, the implant stability comes from a mechanical anchorage, which depends on implant form, screw thread and self-taping design. 3) Implant neck design may have influence for soft tissue recession in esthetic zone. The implant with large shoulder would not be selected for the esthetic area. The platform design may be more favorable in the area. 4) The connection design between implant and abutment is thought a very important structure in implant long-term stability. Moose taper and tube in tube were well documented structure design in 20-year clinical practice in Peking University. 5) In last 15 years, the plenty studies showed the platform design of implant had positive influence in implant marginal bone level. Whatever in single implant restoration or multi-implant prosthesis. 6) The digital technology makes clinical work more precise and high-tech. This would be a trend in implant dentistry. New generation of chair-side digital computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing makes immediate prosthesis without conventional impression possible. 7) New abutment design have changed clinical protocol greatly. The All-on-four concept and Weldone concept benefit both from the abutment innovation, which were large angulated abutment and special welding abutment materials.: computer-aided design; dental implant-abutment design; dental implants; immediate dental implant loading."
6,"Dental implants are reliable to replace teeth lost because of traumatic dental injury. However, dental implants behave like ankylosed teeth and should not be placed in growing individuals because of the risk of infraposition. This risk may be reduced by ensuring arrested skeletal growth and ideal incisal support. The timing of implant placement may be immediate, early, conventional, or late and is determined by the extent of the trauma, remaining growth, and conditions of the hard and soft tissues. Timing should allow an observation period to properly evaluate the prognosis of concomitantly traumatized neighboring teeth. Orthodontic alignment is often necessary after traumatic dental injury in young individuals to provide symmetric dental conditions around the facial midline, to allow implant placement in the correct 3-dimensional position for the later prosthetic reconstruction, and to ensure sufficient mesiodistal space that leaves a minimum of 1.5 mm of healthy alveolar bone between the future implant and neighboring teeth. Space and stable occlusion should be maintained by bonded retainers and a splint used during the night. A partial prosthesis is usually recommended as a temporary replacement. If a fixed provisional prosthesis is required, it is crucial that it does not interfere with the remaining growth and incisal support and allows proper oral hygiene."
7,"As dental implants have become a popular treatment modality for edentulous sites, there is a need for a peri-implant maintenance protocol. This article reviews the anatomy of peri-implant tissues, examines the etiology and risk factors of peri-implant diseases, and outlines nonsurgical and surgical treatment of these diseases. The clinical and radiographic steps necessary to diagnose peri-implant diseases during the phase of peri-implant maintenance, along with available treatment protocols to maintain or recover peri-implant health will be discussed."
8,"This study aimed to assess the literature available on the effects, on peri-implant tissues, of degradation products released from dental implants as a consequence of therapeutic treatment for peri-implantitis and/or of wear-corrosion of titanium. A literature review of the PubMed medline database was performed up to December 31, 2016. The following search terms were used: 'titanium wear and dental implant'; 'titanium corrosion and dental implant'; 'bio-tribocorrosion'; 'peri-implantitis'; 'treatment of peri-implantitis'; 'titanium particles release and dental implant'; and 'titanium ion release and dental implant'. The  were applied to the database in different combinations without limits of time period or type of work. In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles were searched for further studies. Seventy-nine relevant scientific articles on the topic were retrieved. The results showed that pro-inflammatory cytokines, infiltration of inflammatory response cells and activation of the osteoclasts activity are stimulated in peri-implant tissues in the presence of metal particles and ions. Moreover, degenerative changes were reported in macrophages and neutrophils that phagocytosed titanium microparticles, and mutations occurred in human cells cultured in medium containing titanium-based nanoparticles. Debris released from the degradation of dental implants has cytotoxic and genotoxic potential for peri-implant tissues. Thus, the amount and physicochemical properties of the degradation products determine the magnitude of the detrimental effect on peri-implant tissues."
9,"Introduction: Dental implant may serve as a choice of treatment for replacement of missing tooth in diabetic patients with their well-controlled glycemic index. To minimize postoperative complications, dental surgical procedures comprises mainly two types, namely conventional and flapless surgery.: The aim of this review is to find the survival rate of the dental implant when placed with either of the technique, that is, conventional or flapless in patients with controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus from published studies.Materials and : A total of 14 studies were included from PubMed database related to the survival rate of dental implant placement by conventional or flapless surgery among patients with controlled diabetes mellitus. The cumulative mean of dental implant survival rate by conventional and flapless techniques calculated from included studies is 94.2% and 92.3%, respectively. Conclusion: The survival rate of dental implant placement by conventional and flapless techniques is similar. As few studies on flapless technique are available, therefore researchers in future should explore its advantages and disadvantages."
10,"Aim: The aims of this study are to review the available literature related to implant complications and propose a new classification method for dental implant complications. and : Dental literature was reviewed via PubMed focusing on articles published in English, which included data regarding dental implants, complications, and classification from January 2000 to January 2018. The author, who has experience with implant placement and restorations for 15 years, and ten of his colleagues, formed a list of implant complications that they have encountered in their practices.: After 3,736 articles were found in the initial search, a total of 613 potentially relevant review articles were identified in the database. After the full-text analysis of 25 articles, only 6 review articles with complication classifications were utilized in this study. In addition, a clinically based classification named Turkyilmaz's Classification of Implant Complications including three categories was created. Types of complications in these three groups (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) were listed, and some of them were illustrated. Also, recommendations for clinicians were made on how to avoid these problems and/or overcome them.Conclusion: It has been suggested that categorical data regarding complications of dental implants are limited, and the new complication classification presented in this article may help clinicians identify and overcome commonly encountered implant complications.Clinical significance: For clinicians, it is important to know possible complications regarding dental implants. In this article, a group of dentists created and suggested a new classification for implant complications, which may help clinicians identify commonly encountered complications and how to handle them in the clinic.: Complication; Esthetics; Failure; Implant; Nerve injury Success."

12,"Biofilm formation on dental implant surfaces is a serious threat. Up to 50% of all implants show signs of irreversible tissue destruction. The aim of the present systematic review was to summarize the state of the art of strategies to functionalize antimicrobial dental implant surfaces. We searched the following electronic database: SCOPUS, MEDLINE and GOOGLE SCHOLAR and identified relevant controlled trials that evaluated the efficiency of new biomaterial strategies to modify dental implant surfaces, in such a way that biofilm formation was inhibited. The search yielded 2,990 potentially relevant publications. A total of 142 publications met the inclusion criteria. Analysis found that it may be concluded that silver-implanted surfaces, drug-loaded surfaces, surfaces with antimicrobial peptides, bioactive and biopassive polymer coatings as well as nanoscale or UV-activatable surfaces enhance antimicrobial activity compared to commercial pure titanium."
13,"The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the survival rate, the marginal bone level, and the aesthetic outcome; at 3 years' follow-up, of dental implants placed into a high-esthetic aesthetic zone by comparing 2 techniques of postextraction implant with immediate loading: the socket shied technique and the conventional insertion technique.Several clinical studies suggested that the avulsion of a dental element causes dimensional alterations of both soft and hard tissues at the postextractive site. To increase the aesthetic outcomes, the socket-shield technique has been proposed. This method involves maintaining the vestibular root portion and immediate insertion of the dental implant in close proximity to the root.Patients enrolled in this study were randomized to receive a postextraction implant in the aesthetic zone, either with the socket shied technique or with the conventional insertion technique. Implant survival, marginal bone level, and the pink aesthetic score were the outcomes evaluated.Implant survival rate was 100% in both the groups at 3 years. Implants inserted with the socket shield technique showed better values of both marginal bone level and pink aesthetic score (P < 0.05).Although such preliminary results need to be further confirmed, the socket shield technique seems to be a safe surgical technique that allows an implant rehabilitation characterized by better aesthetic outcomes."
14,": The aim of the present study was (a) to evaluate the relationship between dental implant mucosa and dental implant papilla levels; and (b) to identify the clinical parameters associated with peri-implant soft tissue stability over time.: This is a retrospective study on a cohort of patients seeking a single-tooth implant therapy in a private practice in the Paris area. Two independent examiners analyzed photographs and radiographs taken the day of definitive crown load (baseline) and the last follow-up visit (at least 12 months later) in order to measure four peri-implant soft and hard tissue parameters.: Seventy-four patients corresponding to 90 implants were analyzed. During a mean follow-up of 53.88 months, five implants (5.6%) presented with an apical displacement of the mid-facial marginal mucosal level of at least 1 mm. Changes in the mid-facial mucosa level were explained by changes in (a) the keratinized tissue height over time (p < .0001); (b) changes in the papilla height (p < .0001); and (c) by the periodontal phenotype (p = .007). A significant difference between papillae that gain in height (n = 85) and papilla that lost height (n = 78) was observed concerning (a) the timing of the implant placement (p = .019); and (b) the presence of an incomplete papilla fill (distance from the top of the papilla to the contact point) at baseline (p = .004).Conclusions: The present findings indicate a dependent association between dental implant mucosa and dental implant papilla levels. Stability of peri-implant soft tissues depends on periodontal phenotype, keratinized tissue height and papilla height.: dental esthetic; dental implant; papilla; peri-implant soft tissue; recession."
15,"Over past several decades, oral rehabilitation of fully or partially edentulous patients with dental implants has become a routine procedure in daily practice. Dental implant supported and retained prosthesis can provide a wide variety of treatment options to patients due to their high predictability and survival rate. While many patients treated with dental implants have had high long term success, they are not completely free of complications. Proper patient selection, treatment planning, surgical and prosthodontic procedures, material selection and routine maintenance around the peri-implant tissues are keys to this long term success rate."
16,"Achieving predictable outcomes in implant dentistry requires not only an understanding of surgical and prosthetic protocols but also knowledge of bone biology. Regarding implant stability, a distinction exists between non-osseointegrated and osseointegrated implants. Primary or mechanical stability at implant placement is different than secondary or biological stability. Bone quality, implant length, and implant width all influence the achievement of primary stability. This article reviews the contemporary literature on dental implant osseointegration, with the intent of presenting clinicians scientific information concerning the biomechanical parameters and limitations of endosseous implants and their components during the osseointegration phase, as well as their behavior once occlusal forces are present following osseointegration."
17,"New innovative method relating guided surgery to dental implant placementIntroduction: Companies selling dental implant guided systems mostly offer similar surgical guides. The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative-guided surgery system which originality lies in its guidance device, and to report the author's experience in using this system for dental implant surgery.Technical protocol: Two parallel tubes on either side of the drilling axis guide the successive drills and the implant placement. As a result of the lateral guidance, there is no friction of the drills on the surgical guide, which would damage it or contaminate the drilling hole with particles torn out from the guide. No radiological guide is needed during the radiographic examination stage. No successive diameter reduction tubes are requested. This guide can be used for all brands of implants.Discussion: In our experience, 67 implants (31 titanium and 36 zircon implants) were placed in 35 patients with guided surgery system. Multiple clinical cases were treated with this system: 'one-stage' or a 'two-stage' surgical protocol, with flap and flapless surgical techniques, and with delayed or immediate loading. Clinical cases treated revealed good implant placement with planning. The widely open design of this guide allows irrigation and practitioner's sight control under conditions comparable to those of operations performed without surgical guide.Conclusion: This dental implant guided system appears to be a significant advance in the field of implant surgical guides.: Computer-assisted design; Computer-assisted/methods; Dental implantation; Endosseous/instrumentation; Endosseous/methods; Surgery."
18,"Current status of dental implants survival and peri-implant bone loss in patients with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes mellitusPurpose of review: The current review summarizes recent evidence on the impact of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on implant dentistry, highlighting the behavior of peri-implant bone.Recent findings: There is no definitive information on the development and course of peri-implant bone loss associated with T2DM; however, poorly controlled T2DM patients present worse outcomes. Nevertheless, dental implants may be a successful therapy for these patients in a manner similar to healthy individuals, when glycemic levels and oral hygiene are strictly maintained.Summary: The most recent literature on the impact of T2DM on peri-implant bone loss was reviewed to evaluate the feasibility of dental implant therapy over the time for these patients."
19,"Are There Contraindications for Placing Dental Implants?There are few absolute contraindications to dental implant placement. Relative contraindications include cognitive decline, American Society of Anesthesiology patient status IV or higher categories, or medical conditions that may jeopardize the life or lifespan of the patient. Precautions for placing dental implants should be viewed with respect to the evidence-based exposures that can contribute to risk of failure, including but not limited to local, behavioral, and medical factors. Risk for dental implant failure increases in association with (1) past history of periodontal disease, (2) bruxism, (3) smoking, and (4) radiation therapy.: Contraindication; Dental implants; Implant failure; Implant survival; Risk factors."
20,"Titanium dental implant surfaces obtained by anodic spark deposition - From the past to the future Commercial titanium-based dental implants are obtained applying various methods such as machining, acid etching, anodization, plasma spraying, grit blasting or combination techniques yielding materials with smooth or micro-roughened surfaces. Those techniques are used to optimize the surface properties and to maximize biocompatibility and bioactivity with bone tissue. Present review is focused on the material surfaces obtained by anodic spark deposition (ASD). From the early 1980s till present, the results of numerous studies have shown that anodically oxidized surfaces with different dopants express a positive effect on osteoblasts behavior in vitro and osseointegration in vivo. Those surfaces demonstrated a high biocompatibility and rapid osseointegration in clinical application. This paper provides an overview of the preparation of implant surfaces by employing ASD process. Moreover, reviewed are clinically used ASD implant surfaces (Ticer, TiUnite, Osstem, etc.). The electrolyte variations in ASD process and their influence on surface properties are given herein. Using different electrolytes, anode voltages and temperatures, the above fabrication process can yield various surface morphologies from smooth to rough, porous surfaces. Furthermore, ASD enables thickening of oxide layers and enrichment with different dopands from used electrolyte, which hinder release of potentially toxic titanium ions in surrounding tissue. Particularly exciting results were achieved by calcium and phosphorus doping of the oxide layer (Ticer, ZL Microdent; TiUnite, Nobel Biocare Holding AB) which significantly increased the osteocompatibility. Ticer, a dental implant with anodically oxidized surface and the first among similar materials employed in clinical practice, was found to promote fast osteoblast cell differentiation and mineralization processes. Moreover, Ticer accelerate the integration with the bone, increase the bone/implant contact and improve primary and secondary stability of the implants. Additionally, potential innovations in this field such as fabrication of nanotubes on the implant surfaces as well as novel approaches (e.g. coating with proteins, nanostructured topography; combining implant body and surface derived from titanium and zirconia) are elaborated in this review. Besides, biochemical aspects on implant surface cell/tissue interaction are summarized. From the clinical point of view implant surfaces fabricated by ASD technology possess fast and improved osseointegration, high healing rates and long term prognosis.: Anodic spark deposition; Dental implants; In vitro; In vivo; Osseointegration; TiUnite; Ticer."
21,"Dental implant and fungus ball in the ethmoid sinus Dental migration into the ethmoid sinus is extremely rare. Furthermore, it is very unusual that a displaced dental implant is associated with a concomitant fungus ball in the ethmoid sinus. Herein, we report an unusual case of the coexistence of a dental implant and fungus ball in the ethmoid sinus. It appears that this condition has not been reported previously.: dental implants; displacement; endoscopy; ethmoid sinus; mycetoma."
22,Displacement of a Dental Implant into the Pterygoid Fossa: A Clinical Report The placement of dental implants in the pterygomaxillary region can be advantageous in maxillary complete arch fixed implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitations to avoid bone grafting and sinus elevation surgeries. Pterygomaxillary implants improve implant biomechanics by eliminating distal cantilevers and increasing the anteroposterior spread with reported mean implant survival rates comparable to traditional implant sites. Although only minor surgical complications have been reported in the literature with the placement of dental implants in the pterygomaxillary region this clinical report describes a major surgical complication involving the displacement of a dental implant into the pterygoid fossa.

23,"Effect of Platelet-Rich Fibrin and Bone Morphogenetic Protein on Dental Implant Stability Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) bioactive materials have been used to enhance healing and improve dental implant stability. This study aimed to compare the effect of rhBMP-2 and PRF bioactive materials on dental implant stability at different intervals and to evaluate the correlation of implant length and diameter with implant stability.Two bioactive materials were compared to evaluate their effect on dental implant stability. A total of 32 patients (102 dental implants) were divided into 3 groups: 24 dental implants with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), 27 dental implants with PRF, and 51 dental implants without BMP or PRF (control group). Data were statistically analyzed to determine the bioactive material with the best effect on implant stability.Implant stability did not significantly differ between the groups immediately after implant insertion (first reading; P > 0.05). The implant stability of the rhBMP-2 group was significantly better than those of the PRF and control groups 6 weeks after implant insertion (second reading; P = 0.001). After 12 weeks, the effect of rhBMP-2 on implant stability was highly significant and better than that of the other groups (third reading; P < 0.001).Dental implants coated with BMP have a better effect on stability than those with PRF alone and those without PRF or BMP"
24,"Does a higher glycemic level lead to a higher rate of dental implant failure?: A meta-analysis Background: Owing to limited evidence, it is unclear whether diabetes that is not well controlled would lead to a higher rate of dental implant failure. The authors of this meta-analysis evaluated whether the failure rate for patients with diabetes that was not well controlled was higher than the failure rate for patients with well-controlled diabetes.: The authors searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov without limitations for studies whose investigators compared the dental implant failure rates between patients with well-controlled diabetes and diabetes that was not well controlled. The authors pooled the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values to estimate the relative effect of the glycemic level on dental implant failures. The authors used a subgroup analysis to identify the association between the implant failure rate and the stage at which the failure occurred. The authors included 7 studies in this meta-analysis, including a total of 252 patients and 587 dental implants. The results of the pooled analysis did not indicate a direct association between the glycemic level in patients with diabetes and the dental implant failure rate (RR, 0.620; 95% CI, 0.225-1.705). The pooled RR in the subgroup of patients who experienced early implant failure was 0.817 (95% CI, 0.096-6.927), whereas in the subgroup of patients who experienced late implant failure, the pooled RR was 0.572 (95% CI, 0.206-1.586). On the basis of the evidence, the results of this meta-analysis failed to show a difference in the failure rates for dental implants between patients with well-controlled diabetes and patients with diabetes that was not well controlled. However, considering the limitations associated with this meta-analysis, the authors determined that future studies that are well designed and provide adequate controls for confounding factors are required.

25,"What Affects Postoperative Sinusitis and Implant Failure after Dental Implant: A Meta-analysis : The dental implant is an innovative instrument that enables the edentulous patient to chew. Many factors have a bearing on the success of dental implantation. There are also many complications after dental implantation. In this meta-analysis, we investigated which factors increase the risk of postoperative sinusitis and implant failure after dental implant for the first time. Included data were searched through the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and 2 authors (J.S.K., S.H.K.) independently extracted data by multiple observers. We used a random-effects model considering the variation between and within the included studies. Twenty-seven studies were included in our final meta-analysis. The proportion of postoperative sinusitis, perforation of the sinus membrane, and implant failure was 0.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.07), 0.17 (95% CI, 0.13-0.22), and 0.05 (95% CI, 0.04-0.07), respectively, using the single proportion test. The only factors that affected postoperative sinusitis were preoperative sinusitis and intraoperative perforation of the Schneiderian membrane ( P < .01 and P < .01, respectively). The only factors that affected dental implant failure were smoking and residual bone height of the maxilla ( P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Two factors affect postoperative sinusitis after implant surgery: preoperative sinusitis and Schneiderian membrane rupture. It should also be noted that the factors affecting implant failure are residual bone height and smoking. These findings will have a significant impact on the counseling and treatment policy of patients who receive dental implants. Schneiderian membrane perforation; dental implant; implant failure; sinusitis; smoking; survival."
26,"Accidental Swallowing of Dental Implant: Complication of Transnasal Endoscopic Removal From Maxillary Sinus Transnasal endoscopic removal of displaced dental implants in the maxillary sinus can be done easily under local anesthesia. However, very little is known regarding the precaution of this technique. In this report, we present the case of a 63-year-old man who visited the otolaryngologic department with a displaced dental implant in the maxillary sinus. Transnasal endoscopic removal of the displaced dental implant was planned and performed. However, the displaced dental implant was lost during removal. The implant was not seen in the other parts of the nasal cavity nor in the other parts of the oral cavity. Finally, radiographs revealed the presence of the dental implant at the level of the esophagus, although the patient did not notice anything because of local anesthesia. Thus, we conclude that operators should take into account the possibility of aspiration or swallowing of an implant through the posterior nasal aperture during the removal procedure. Precautions should be taken to avoid the possibility of implant aspiration or implant ingestion."
27,"Patients' experiences of dental implant treatment: A literature review of key qualitative studies s: To identify and summarise the findings of previous qualitative studies relating to patients' experience of dental implant treatment (DIT) at various stages of their implant treatment, by means of textual narrative synthesis. Original articles reporting patients' experience with dental implant were included. A two-stage search of the literature, electronic and hand search identified relevant qualitative studies up to July 2014. An extensive electronic search was conducted of databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Database and Google Scholar. Included primary studies (n=10) used qualitative research methods and qualitative analysis to investigate patients' experiences with dental implants treatment. While the growing interest in implant treatment for the replacement of missing dentition is evident, it is essential to investigate patients' perceptions of different aspects of implant treatment. This textual narrative synthesis conducted to review qualitative studies which provided insight into patients' experience of two types of implant prostheses namely ISOD (implant-supported overdenture) and FISP (fixed implant supported prostheses). Primary reviewed studies tended to include samples of older patients with more extensive tooth loss, and to focus on experiences prior to and post-treatment rather than on the treatment period itself. Findings across reviewed studies (n=10) suggested that patients with FISP thought of implant treatment as a process of 'normalisation'(1) and believed that such implant restorations could be similar to natural teeth, whereas patients with ISOD focused more on the functional and social advantages of their implant treatment. The growing interest in qualitative research is evident in several branches of clinical dentistry and dental implantology is not an exception. Qualitative studies concerning the patients account of their experience of dental implants is however limited. The aim of this review is to firstly identify recent work within this field and to subsequently categorise it more consistently by means of textural narrative synthesis, thus highlighting similarities and differences and enabling identification of gaps in research knowledge thereby setting the direction of further research.

28,"Evaluation of postoperative dental implant primary stability using 3D finite element analysis The goal of this work was to use finite element analysis (FEA) to evaluate the primary stability of the dental implant without further in vivo measurements. Through proper simulations the information about stability could be obtained faster and easier than in vitro or in vivo studies. Four dental implants were chosen to evaluate their implant stability in various grades of bone. The 3D CAD models of these implants were reengineered via stereo microscopic measurements and the reengineered models were placed in artificial bone samples. Our approach was to simulate the micro mobility with FEA in various types of dental implants to see the differences between them and to convert the simulated micro mobility to Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ). The ISQ was chosen as the representation of implant stability because it is a general index-number of implant stability and it could also be measured with a standard commercially available device in clinics. After performing the simulations, the effect of the predrilling procedures on one exact implant type was investigated. Due to the numerous simulations it can be concluded that the implant stability (ISQ) can be effectively simulated via FEA, moreover the behavior of different implants in different type of surrounding bone tissues can also be evaluated. With this method it is possible to predict and to monitor the stability of known and also of novel dental implants before implantation.

29,"Dental implant biomaterials. Synthetic materials for surgical implant devices have evolved from the early metallic systems to a variety of material combinations and composites. Current biomaterial and biomechanical properties provide relatively optimal stable bone and soft tissue interfaces and simplified restorative treatments. Further improvements in existing systems require a continuation of the multidisciplinary approach to laboratory, experimental animal, and human clinical research."
30,"Dental implant infections. Dental implants provide a restorative tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. Osseointegrated implants are titanium posts that are surgically implanted in alveolar bone. A tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures are attached to the implants. Titanium implants differ from natural teeth, which may make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. A small proportion of implants are not successful and may fail due to infection. The microbiota of implants is similar to that of teeth in similar clinical states. Implants that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. Infected implants are colonized by subgingival species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection."
31,"Implementation of a surgical safety checklist for dental implant surgeries in a prosthodontics residency program.Statement of problem: Surgical safety checklists are commonly used in medical surgery to reduce errors, yet they are rarely used in the dental office. Presently, research on the implementation of surgical safety checklists in implant dentistry and user adherence is lacking. The primary purpose of this quality assessment study was to evaluate user compliance by using a surgical safety checklist for dental implant surgeries in a postgraduate prosthodontics program at the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine. The secondary purpose was to identify and analyze the nature, number, and frequency of omitted items on the surgical safety checklist. All surgical safety checklists completed by 8 prosthodontic residents from 120 dental implant surgeries over the course of 1 academic year were collected as part of the program's quality assessment. Each surgical safety checklist contained 12 preoperative items and 14 postoperative items, giving a total of 26 items to be analyzed for each dental implant surgery. The collected data were then analyzed for user compliance, as well as the nature, number, and frequency of omitted items.Surgical safety checklists from 120 dental implant surgeries encompassing 262 implants were accessed for the academic year cycle from July 2017 to June 2018. There were 6 additional dental implant surgeries whose checklists were inaccessible. There was a 100% compliance rate for surgical safety checklist completion by all 8 prosthodontic residents across 120 dental implant surgeries. Within the checklists, the rate of incomplete responses or omissions was 2.4% (n=77). The 5 most commonly omitted items on the checklist by residents were preoperative photographs (0.29%), postoperative analgesics or steroids (0.26%), preoperative oral antiseptic rinse (0.22%), postoperative prescriptions (0.19%), and signed prosthodontic treatment plan forms (0.16%). There was excellent compliance with the implemented dental implant surgical safety checklist across 8 prosthodontic residents, and the number of omitted items was small. Surgical safety checklists appear to be a straightforward method of helping prosthodontic residents in their dental implant surgical training to provide consistent and high-quality safe treatment for patients."
32,"Dental implants and single implant-supported restorations. Replacing missing teeth using dental implants is a good treatment option with a high degree of success. As the dental implantology field develops and the number of implants placed worldwide increases, several terms and techniques have been formulated. Therefore, a basic knowledge of dental implants is necessary for every dental student and dentist. The current article sheds light on how the dental implant integrates with its surrounding bone and what factors can affect this integration. The relationship between the implant and its surrounding soft tissue, different types of the dental implants, and the restorative components and procedures, are all reviewed."
33,"Dental Implant Quality Register-A possible tool to further improve implant treatment and outcome. The Board of EAO (European Association for Osseointegration) has discussed an initiative to explore the conditions to establish a Dental Implant Register. It was suggested to bring this issue to the EAO Consensus Conference 2018 for a discussion and to possibly propose relevant and manageable parameters. This article presents some select examples from quality registers in the medical field. Based on the experience of established registers, essentially in the medical field, factors considered to be of importance, if and when establishing a Dental Implant Register are introduced and discussed. clinical assessment; clinical research; clinical trials; diagnosis; epidemiology; patient centered outcomes."
34,"Innovative method  technique and dental implant design for grafting injectable platelet-rich fibrin around the dental implant - Goat jaw cadaver study.Aims: Dental implants have revolutionized the treatment modality for replacing missing teeth. The ability of implants to osseointegrate with the bone leads to its success. The problem is sometimes there is inadequate bone available for implant. If hygiene is not maintained, biofilms of bacteria can be formed around the dental implant. One approach to this problem has been development of bioactive surgical additives. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) appears as an alternative. There are various techniques of using PRF. These techniques need skill and practice to use PRF. To evaluate implant stability and flow of injectable PRF (i-PRF) of regular implant and modified innovative design implant. Thirty goat jaw bones were selected. Implants were placed in mandibular posterior region. Fifteen implants were placed using regular dental implant system (Group A) on the left side of jaw bone. The other 15 implants were placed using modified dental implant (Group B) on the right side of jaw bone. The body of these implants at middle has drainage vents to drain/flow the i-PRF-like dye. The dye was injected through regular and modified implants (DV-PIMS technique). Then the stability was checked with the help of Periotest. Cross section was taken 3 cm away from dental implant at the angle of mandible, to check the flow of i-PRF/platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-like dye.Periotest evaluation showed a mean of 2.3 for implant Group B and a mean of 1.5 for implant Group A. The flow of i-PRF-like dye was seen in Group B, and Group A does not show any flow.There are various techniques of using PRF. These techniques need skill and practice to use PRF. This (DV-PIMS) method aims to explain new implant design that disperses an i-PRF solution from inside out. The screw section of the new implant is made of a reservoir running vertically down inside. That reservoir is filled with (injectable) PRF, and then a cover screw is placed. The solution will begin to slowly diffuse out, through the vents in implant, keeping biofilms from forming or avoiding at the screw-bone interface and accelerate healing process.

35,"Chronological Age as Factor Influencing the Dental Implant Osseointegration in the Jaw Bone.The s of this study were to evaluate osseointegration of dental implant in the jaw bone in the young and elderly population and comparing the results to assess indicators and risk factors as age for the success or failure of dental implants. A retrospective study of 107 implants (Impladent, LASAK, Czech Republic) was prepared. The patients at implants surgery were divided in three groups. The patients were followed-up for a 7-year period. We evaluated osseointegration from long term point of view as a change of marginal bone levels close to dental implant. Marginal bone levels were recorded and analysed with regard to different patient- and implant-related factors. An influence of chronological age on change of marginal bone levels during 6-year retrospective study vas evaluated. The study examined 47 patient charts and 107 implants from the Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol. We proved that young healthy patients with long bridges or Branemarks have the same progression of marginal bone levels changes. The chronological age hasn't therefore direct influence on the osseointegration from long term point of view. But we found that the length of dental suprastrucure-prosthetic construction negatively influences marginal bone changes, though these results weren't statistically significant. More extensive dental implant suprastrucure undergoes smaller osseointegration. On the other hand the length of dental suprastrucure (prosthetic construction) negatively influences dental osseointegration in both groups of patient.

36,"Will any dental implant do? Dental implant treatment is a well-documented technology, but sadly with the passage of time, the vast majority of dental implants sold on the market today have little of their own documentation. All implants are not the same and the consequences of 'look-alike' implants relying on the documentation of others may be far-reaching. This opinion piece highlights concerns identified in the literature and exposes problems that are already occurring in reality."
37,"Research progress of dental implant in patients with oral lichen planus. In recent years, the range of indications for dental implants has undergone many modifications and has been widened. In the past, oral lichen planus was regarded as contraindication for the placement of implants. According to recent literature, some patients with oral lichen planus have been selected for dental implantology, indicating comparable implant survival rate to patients without oral lichen planus. Nevertheless, clinical information on this topic is still scarce and evidence-based treatment guidelines are not available. This paper reviews the research progress of dental implant in patients with oral lichen planus, discusses the benefits and risks of implant rehabilitation in this group of patients and proposes treatment recommendations based on existing studies.

38,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dental implant failure-A significant concern in elders?Objective: Depression is a significantly prevalent health concern in geriatric populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs (SSRI) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressant agents, with increasing rates of prescription. The present report aimed to present a concise review of the current understanding regarding SSRI effects on bone and dental implant outcomes. A broad-based review and summary of literature pertaining to the effects of SSRI on bone metabolism and on dental implant survival was performed. The available literature indicates that serotonin plays a significant role in bone metabolism and experimental reports demonstrate adverse impacts of SSRI on multiple pathways of bone metabolism. Early clinical reports suggest detrimental effects of SSRI on dental implant survival. The type of SSRI drug, dosage and host-related genetic and metabolic factors could be potential modulating factors. There is a paucity of data regarding SSRI usage and dental implant survival specific to geriatric cohorts. As older individuals comprise a high-risk group for both high oral rehabilitation and SSRI use, clinicians should be aware the potential association between SSRI and dental implant failures. Well-designed investigations specific to geriatric cohorts are essential to understand the implications of SSRI use on dental implant prognosis. ageing; bone; dental implants; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs."
39,"The Emergency Dental Appointment: Restorative Emergencies Part 2 - Dental Implant Related Problems.This is the second paper in a two-part series discussing the management of common restorative dental emergencies. The first paper focussed upon problems relating to conventional fixed and removable restorations, and this paper discusses the management of common dental implant related emergencies. With dental implant treatment becoming an increasingly popular method of replacing missing teeth, it is very likely that dentists working in general practice will routinely come across patients who have previously undergone this form of treatment, even if they themselves are not directly involved in placing or restoring dental implants. This paper is aimed at general dental practitioners (GDPs) who have some experience in managing dental implants, and those who want to gain further insight into how such situations may be managed."
40,"Short dental implant as alternative to long implant with bone augmentation of the atrophic posterior ridge: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.Objective: To evaluate if short implants without augmentation can be considered a successful alternative treatment modality in the rehabilitation of posterior atrophic ridges when compared to standard-length implants with augmentation. Electronic searches were performed in the PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared short implants and standard implants with augmentation were the only articles included. Titles and abstracts were screened, data were extracted, and articles were assessed for risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed for 13 of the included RCTs that had similar outcome measures. Of the total 17 relevant studies identified, 13 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed no significant differences regarding the implant failure rate at 1 year (I2 = 67%, P = .13; risk difference [RD]: -0.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.11, 0.01), at 3 years (I2 = 58%, P = .17; RD: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.02), and at 5 to 10 years (I2 = 0%, P = .47; RD: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.19, 0.09). However, the meta-analyses of 10 trials regarding the postoperative complications of short- and standard-length dental implants showed a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications in the standard-length dental implant group at 1 year (I2 = 93%, P = .02; RD: -0.21, 95% CI: -0.39, -0.04). Short dental implants seem to be an effective alternative treatment for the atrophic posterior ridge. The pooled data revealed that short dental implants have statistically less marginal bone loss and fewer postoperative complications when compared to standard-length dental implants with augmentation. However, there are no statistically significant differences in regard to implant failure. bone graft; dental implants; implantology; implants; systematic review."
41,"Role of Dental Implant Superstructure in Patients with Severe Periodontal Disease.Many studies have investigated the relationship between periodontal disease and the onset of peri-implantitis. It is important to devise practical measures for preventing the development of peri-implantitis in patients with periodontal disease if the success of implant treatment is to be secured. Here, we report the role of the superstructure in two cases of implant treatment in patients with severe periodontal disease. Both patients had severe periodontitis and underwent implant treatment after improving the state of the disease, thereby ensuring that the implant superstructure could be maintained. Both cases remained stable after implant treatment. The results indicate that proper periodontal treatment prior to implant treatment leads to long-term success. In addition, it is necessary to use an implant superstructure that reduces plaque accumulation in preventing peri-implantitis.Keywords: Dental implant; Implant superstructure; Peri-implantitis; Periodontal disease."
42,"Epithelial attachment and downgrowth on dental implant abutments--a comprehensive review. The soft tissues around dental implants are enlarged compared with the gingiva because of the longer junctional epithelium and the hemidesmosonal attachments are fewer, suggestive of a poorer quality attachment. Inflammatory infiltrates caused by bacterial colonization of the implant-abutment interface are thought to be one of the factors causing epithelial downgrowth and subsequent peri-implant bone loss. Gold alloys and dental ceramics as well as the contamination of the implant surface with amino alcohols, appear to promote epithelial downgrowth. Physical manipulaton of the abutment surfaces, including concave abutment designs, platform switching, and microgrooved surfaces are believed to inhibit epithelial downgrowth and minimizes bone loss at the implant shoulder. This paper reviews the factors that are believed to influence the migration of epithelial attachment the dental implant and abutment surfaces. Exploration of innovative computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing-based concepts such as one abutment - one time and their effect on epithelial downgrowth are discussed. Based on the review of current literature, the authors recommend inserting definitive abutments at the time of surgical uncovering. To implement this concept, registration of the implant position should to be taken at the time of surgical implant placement."
43,"Zirconia dental implants: A clinical and radiographic evaluation. Objective: Limited clinical evidence has been reported in dental literature regarding zirconia dental implants. The aim of the present retrospective consecutive case series was to evaluate the clinical outcome of zirconia dental implants with 1 to 5 years of follow-up.: The clinical outcome of 24 implants in 12 consecutive patients (male 5, female 7) with a mean age of 55 years (range 27-86) is reported. Radiographic crestal bone level was assessed by the use of ImageJ software program. Gingival and plaque indices were recorded at baseline and latest follow-up. The overall success rate of zirconia implants was 92%. Within the limitations of the present clinical evaluation, zirconia implants provided excellent clinical results and esthetic outcomes. A mean periimplant bone loss of 0.3 mm was measured in 33.3% of the implants and 66.7% were not affected by radiographic detectable periimplant bone loss. Two implants in two patients failed. Low gingival and plaque indices were predominant values for both interim and final restorations. The apparent less affinity to plaque accumulation may favor soft tissue health around zirconia dental implants and decrease the risk of inflammation or infection. Zirconia dental implant merits further investigation. Zirconia dental implants are emerging as an option in clinical practice of implant dentistry providing stable clinical results and esthetic outcomes. case series; ceramic; periimplant bone; zirconia; zirconia dental implants."
44,"Provision of information on dental implant treatment: Patients' thoughts and experiences. Objectives: To explore patients' thoughts and perceptions of information provision regarding dental implant treatment. This generic qualitative study involved 38 semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews with 34 participants, who were at different stages of dental implant treatment. The interviews were transcribed verbatim. The data collection and coding process followed the principles of qualitative thematic analysis. Clinical sources of information were generally trusted by patients; however, patients clearly lacked information relative to their own specific situation, concerns and preferences, and this may lead to patients' reliance on other general sources of information. Crucial information on the long-term prosthesis needs was requested by patients at all treatment stages. Issues concerning the longevity and functional capability of the implant restoration and the long-term maintenance including optimisation of hygiene practice were questioned by patients and required greater explanation. With growing patient interest in implants for replacement of missing teeth, complete and accurate knowledge and understanding of implants should be established with patients. This should be undertaken with more reliance on reliable clinically based sources of implant information.: dental implant; implant prosthesis; implant surgery; information provision; patients’ expectations."
45,"Research progress in titanium dental implant biological modification. During the past three decades, the technology of implant surface modification has already formed well-developed methods including physical and chemical means. However, titanium is a kind of bioinert material, which will directly result in slowly bone-bond with bone tissue after implantation and ultimately reduce the success rate of dental implant surgery. Therefore, the introduction of bioactive substances which can effectively regulate and promote the proliferation of bone cells to modify the titanium implant surface has received tremendous attention in the research of oral implant field. The research of biological modification starts relatively late and it has not formed well-established system yet. The research progress is given in this paper concerning the bioactivators and methods used in biological modification. Furthermore, the current situation as well as the recent developments involving the biological modification of dental implant are also discussed in this review.: Biological modification; Dental implantation; Titanium."
46,"Endoscopic Removal of a Dental Implant From Maxillary Sinus. The displacement of a dental implant into the maxillary sinus during surgery or after a period of use is a complication defined in the dental implant clinical practice. This complication arises primarily from inadequate bone height and peri-implant infection. Specifically, foreign objects in the maxillary sinus can cause sinusitis via impaired mucociliary flow and foreign body reactions, so they must be removed. Caldwell-Luc, transnasal, and intraoral endoscopic sinus surgeries have all been used to remove such foreign bodies and lesions from maxillary sinuses. In this article, the authors present the case of a patient whose dental implant slipped into the right maxillary sinus after a period of use and describe the endoscopic removal of said implant via an intraoral approach. The endoscopic removal of the dental implant from the maxillary sinus proved to be a safe, reliable, and minimally invasive method."
47,"Does HIV infection have an impact upon dental implant osseointegration? A systematic review. Objective: A systematic review is made to determine whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has an impact upon dental implant osseointegration. A PubMed (MEDLINE) literature search was made of articles published up until 14 April 2014. The systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The quality of the studies included in the review was assessed using the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) and levels of evidence (based on the University of Oxford's Center for Evidence Based Medicine criteria). The combinations of search terms resulted in a list of 132 titles. Nine studies finally met the inclusion criteria and were selected for inclusion in the systematic review. A total of 173 dental implants were placed in 80 patients (135 implants in 56 HIV-positive subjects and 38 implants in 24 HIV-negative patients), and a single loss of dental implant osseointegration was recorded in an HIV-positive patient. Our results suggest that dental implant placement in HIV-positive patients does not increase the dental implant failure rate. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment, the administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy, and control of the CD4+ T lymphocyte counts appear to be the main influencing factors in this respect. Given the few studies included in our systematic review, further prospective studies involving larger sample sizes and longer durations of follow-up are required in order to confirm the results obtained."

49,"Factors Affecting Dental Implant Stability Measured Using the Ostell Mentor Device: A Systematic Review.Objectives: The aim of this study was to review the literature on factors that may affect dental implant stability as measured with the Ostell mentor device. A systematic search of the literature was performed in Pubmed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases using dental implants, stability, and resonance frequency analysis as key words. The most relevant randomized controlled trials and clinical trials (n = 39) were selected from among 264 articles. Many factors can affect dental implant stability as measured with the Ostell mentor device. This may be a useful instrument for deciding the timing of implant loading, but additional research is required to establish the reliability and predictability of resonance frequency analysis for the future osseointegration of dental implants, which remains controversial."
50,"Outcomes of Dental Implant Therapy in Patients With Down Syndrome: A Systematic Review.Objectives: Patients with Down syndrome (DS) require an earlier and more frequent tooth replacement than rest of the population. The objective of this systematic review is to critically analyze and summarize studies to ascertain the outcomes and survival of dental implants placed in jaws of DS patients. Using the key words dental implants,  Down syndrome, prosthodontics,  an electronic search was conducted via PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, Embase, and Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases by 2 authors, S.N. and Z.K., independently. Retrieved studies were screened against the predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria. To estimate the risk of bias, quality assessment of included studies was carried using the 'Case Reports (CARE) guidelines'. Primary search resulted in 156 studies. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and reporting a total of 81 dental implants placed in 36 DS patients. The type of implant loading ranged from immediate to a delay of 1 year after placement of the implant. Implant diameter ranged from 3.3 to 4.5 mm, and height ranged from 8.5 to 18 mm. The follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years. Of 81 implants placed, 21 implants (26%) were reported as failed Patients with DS have a higher risk of implant failure. However, the reason for the failure is not very well understood. Although case reports and case series suggest that implant survival is diminished in DS patients, large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to determine the exact mechanism associated with risks of implant failure.

51,"Timing of soft tissue management around dental implants: a suggested protocol. Survival of dental implants depends on several factors; soft tissue (ST) management around dental implants is one of the foremost. Several studies have suggested techniques for ST management around dental implants, but none of them has discussed a suitable timetable for this process. This study aimed to review published articles related to the timing of ST management around dental implants and suggest a customized treatment protocol. A search of the PubMed database was conducted; the search was limited to English-language articles published from January 1995 to July 2015 with available full texts. Only in vivo studies and clinical trials in relation to the terms soft tissue management, management timing, keratinized mucosa, free gingival graft, connective tissue graft, soft tissue, augmentation, and dental implant were included. A total of 492 articles were reviewed, and eventually 42 articles were thoroughly evaluated. Those with treatment protocols in terms of the timing of ST grafting were selected and classified. ST management around dental implants may be done prior to the surgical phase, after the surgical phase, before loading, or even after loading. A thick gingival biotype is more suitable for implant placement, providing more favorable esthetic results. A treatment plan should be based on individual patient needs as well as the knowledge and experience of the clinician. The width and thickness of keratinized tissues, the need for bone management, and local risk factors that influence esthetic results determine the appropriate time for ST augmentation procedures. connective tissue; dental implant; free gingival graft; keratinized mucosa; regeneration; soft tissue."
52,"The effect of static load on dental implant survival: a systematic review. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the current evidence related to the effects of static loading on the long-term stability of the osseointegrated interface. The literature search was conducted using Medline supplemented by SCOPUS and the Cochrane databases as well as hand searching from references of reviewed papers. Relevant studies were selected according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Key words used in the search included: dental implant passive fit, dental implant misfit, dental implant static load, dental implant overload, orthodontic forces, and dental implants. The initial database search yielded 192 relevant titles. After the subsequent filtering process, 36 studies were finally selected. Twenty-eight articles involved animal studies and eight articles involved human studies. The results of this systematic review demonstrate that there is no apparent detrimental effect of static loading on osseointegrated dental implants."
53,"Use of High Performance Polymers as Dental Implant Abutments and Frameworks: A Case Series Report.Dental implant abutments can be made of different materials including titanium, gold, zirconia, alumina, and polymeric materials. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a high performance thermoplastic polymer that can be used as a dental implant abutment material. It has an elastic modulus comparable to bone and can reduce stress shielding. PEEK is a radiolucent material that can allow better radiographic imaging of peri-implant tissues and can be veneered with composite materials or bonded to ceramics. PEEK is widely used in orthopedic and spinal surgeries, and it possesses mechanical and biological characteristics that encourage its use as dental implant abutments. This article will review the use of PEEK in dentistry and in particular as a dental implant abutment and over implant framework. Clinical reports will be presented to suggest some uses of PEEK materials in implant dentistry. Implant abutment; PEEK; longevity."

An IID is also useful to position multiple implant abutments on implants. Several methods have been used to fabricate an IID. However, the existing methods are labor-intensive. This article presents a digital workflow for fabricating an IID using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology with minimal human error."
55,"Dental implant esthetics. As dental implants have become an increasingly popular restorative therapy and their stability and functional benefits have become widely acknowledged, newly applied surgical and prosthetic techniques are enabling dentists to approach patients' esthetic expectations. Esthetic results of implant-supported fixed bridges, retrievable bridges, and overdentures are influenced by the amount of soft and bone tissue as well as by the placement of the implants themselves. Tissue augmentation procedures that restore normal tissue contour and allow more ideal implant placement help minimize esthetic compromises. The use of modified abutments that are angulated and placed directly in the implant can offset weak implant placement. Finally, overdentures should be constructed if these techniques cannot be used or if their use still results in compromised esthetic results."
56,"Nonsurgical and surgical management of biologic complications around dental implants: peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis.Biologic complications around dental implants may be categorized into peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Peri-implant mucositis is defined as reversible inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa without any apparent bone destruction. Peri-implantitis refers to inflammatory process that resulted in destruction of alveolar bone and attachment. Potential etiologic and contributing factors to both diseases are discussed in this review. By targeting and eliminating the etiologic factors nonsurgically as well as surgically, dental implants presenting with peri-implant diseases may be rescued, and then maintained with proper long-term peri-implant supportive therapy. Furthermore, clinical cases and their management are presented to demonstrate the available treatment options. Implant therapy should be carefully planned and executed with consideration of potential etiologic and contributing factors to developing biologic complications. During the initial consideration, patients should be informed of the potential biologic complications in dental implant therapy. Clinicians should monitor implants for any development or recurrence of peri-implant disease to ensure timely therapeutic intervention. bone loss; implant failure; implant success; peri-implant disease; periodontitis."
57,"Effects of pain management on dental implant patients during perioperative period.Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of pain management for dental implant patients during perioperative period, in order to improve nursing care of ambulatory dental implant surgery. One hundred patients requiring ambulatory dental implant surgery were randomly divided into management group or control group, several intervention measures of pain management were provided for patients in management group, while only conventional nursing care were taken for patients in control group. The data were analyzed with SPSS 16.0 software package. With the same level of mental strain, patients in management group showed a lower pain rate and higher satisfaction rate, which were significantly different from the control group. Pain management for dental implant patients during perioperative period can reduce patients' discomfort, improve patients' satisfaction, and facilitate patients' rehabilitation."
58,"Statistical analysis of implant and thread parameters effects on dental implant stability and bone resorption using central composite design method. The effect of dental implant parameters, length and diameter, and thread parameters consisting of thread depth, width, pitch and inner angle on Max von-Mises stress in implant-abutment and cancellous bone is investigated. A three-dimensional finite element model of a threaded dental implant and mandibular segment is built. Face-centered central composite design is applied as the design of experiments method to study and optimize the six independent variable parameters at three levels by applying response surface methodology. The simultaneous analysis of these parameters is run to obtain a better perspective on their effects on responses. The effects of linear, square, and interactive terms on responses through Pareto, main effects, and interaction plots are determined through analysis of variance. A second-order polynomial equation is fitted to the model to predict the response magnitude. The results indicate that implant diameter and its interaction with thread depth are effective in decreasing the likelihood of bone resorption. The implant length affects the Max von-Mises stress in implant-abutment, with no effect on the Max von-Mises stress in cancellous bone. The optimization process caused about 10% and 30% reduction in the magnitude of Max von-Mises stress in implant-abutment and cancellous bone, respectively.

59,"The influence of dental implant surface on osseointegration: review. Dental implant therapy is a prevalent and successful treatment, based on research and clinical experience. Ossointegration is the main factor that responsible for success or failure, initially of the implant, and in some cases followed with the whole treatment failure. The osseointegration process is influenced by several factors, among them the surface texture. Dental implants are available with different surface modifications that have been developed for enhancing clinical performances. This paper reviews the main treatments used for changing dental titanium implant surfaces, and compare the clinical performance of different types of implants. Based on existent literature, modified implant surface improves significantly the ability to achive optimise bone-implant contact and improve osseointegration. This review did not find any significant major differences between the surface modifications in use this days in terms of survival and success of specific implant. There are several methods that are no longer in use, due to poor clinical performance in the past."
